# Converting images to sound
### Sensory substitution as a tool for the blind

This was created as a final project for PSYCH 6420.  It converts images to sound, as well as processes images into their edge maps, and converts the edge maps to sound.

Originally written in a Jupyter notebook, I have also included image-to-sound.py so that the script can be executed from the command line.
